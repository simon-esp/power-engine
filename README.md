# power-engine
A not so powerful engine that allows easy multiplayer (soon)

#HOW IT WORKS
Power engine uses a sprite-based system, where you can add
attributes and change the possition of an individual sprite.
##Sprites
Sprites are divided in several groups. As of now there is
`Object, Head, Text, Collision`
Use them accordingly for the best experience.
##Scripting
The engine uses a custom made programming language, `pw#`,
it uses the sprite system to easily move, turn, and stop
objects. To add it to a sprite, you dont add it as a child,
but you apply it in the script itself, making it less confusing
than traditional engines (cant say the same for conditions
system lol). Docs are located in `"DOCS.md"`
